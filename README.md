Abstract
--------

This thesis documents my research into formalized score control, in order to
demonstrate a computational model of music composition. When working
computationally, models provide an explicit formal description of what objects
exist within a given domain, how they behave, and what transformations they
afford. The clearer the model becomes, the easier it is to extend and to
construct increasingly higher-order abstractions around that model. In other
words, a clear computational model of music notation affords the development of
a clear model of music composition. The Abjad API for Formalized Score Control,
an open-source software library written in the Python programming language and
making use of the LilyPond automated typesetting system for graphical output,
is presented as such a computational model of music notation. My own
compositional modeling work, extending Abjad, is introduced and analyzed in the
Python library Consort. A collection of five scores, each implemented as Python
packages extending these software libraries, are included. Three of these
scores, *Zaira*, *Armilla* and *Ersilia*, rely on Consort as their
compositional engine, and are presented along with their complete sources.
These scores demonstrate my development as a composer investigating the role of
computation in music, and display a variety of large-scale structures and
musical textures made possible when working with such modeling tools.
